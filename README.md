### Algorithmic-trading

This repo aims to provide a comprehensive list of notebooks that implement several strategies for algorithmic trading, more specifically, stock price predictions using moving average, Bollinger bands, etc. 
Evaluation of these strategies will be implemented using back-testing. Furthermore, I will also explore data science and machine learning models.
Some of the notebooks focus on short-term trading while others implement long-term investment strategies. This work is currently is on-going and much of the documentation is missing. Keep watching for updates.

Note: Many of the ideas/codes in this projcts are modifid versions from other sources.
